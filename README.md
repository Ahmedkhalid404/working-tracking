# Working-Tracking

**Working-Tracking** is a program that helps you track the activities you do during the day.  
You choose the activity you are working on and click **Start**, and it will track the time until you click **Stop**.  
You can also add notes to the activity, add or delete activities, analyze your activity history, and generate a report for a specific start and end date showing all activities in detail.
